## Project Brief
To produce an application, consisting of four microservices, all interacting with one another to generate objects using a defined logic. 
The application was to be produced and maintained using a fully automated CI/CD Pipeline, with the full technology stack being:
* Kanban Board (Trello) for project tracking
* Git (with the use also of Github) for version control
* Jenkins acting as the CI server
* Ansible for configuration management
* Google Cloud Platform as the cloud platform
* Docker as the containerisation tool
* Docker Swarm for container orchestration
* NGINX as the reverse proxy
