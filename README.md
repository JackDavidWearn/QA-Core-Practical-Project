* Kanban Board (Trello) for project tracking
* Git (with the use also of Github) for version control
* Jenkins acting as the CI server
* Ansible for configuration management
* Google Cloud Platform as the cloud platform
* Docker as the containerisation tool
* Docker Swarm for container orchestration
* NGINX as the reverse proxy
